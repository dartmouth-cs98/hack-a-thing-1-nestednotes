# Hack a Thing 1 - Nested Notes
Created for CS98 by Adam Phillips and Robert Sayegh

## Short description of what we attempted to build
Apple bundles very feature-rich notes and reminders apps into its iOS software. However, some of the key functionality in the notes app is absent from the reminders app and vice-versa. We thus built out our own notes app and took one of those features, the ability to nest notes as children of a parent, and implemented it using react-native. We based our notes app off of the react native tutorial app found here: https://hellokoding.com/todo-app-with-react-native/

## Who did what
We pair programmed for the entirety of the project and spent all of the development time together. For the first half of our coding time, we were individually experimenting with react native and trying to figure out the intracacies of the platform, working on various other tutorials and independently based on features we had read about. Then we spent the second half of our time on the project submitted here.

## What you learned
How to quickly get a viable react native app onto a phone and running! We also both brushed up significantly on our javascript.

## What didn't work
We had a number of problems getting code to compile at the beginning. After hours of debugging, we traced it to a combination of the environment we had running from our previous installs of node, npm, and react, and well as a series of outdated instructions on the tutorials which we troubleshooted and resolved.
